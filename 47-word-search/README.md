Of course. This code solves the "Word Search" problem on a 2D grid. It uses a recursive technique called **backtracking**, which is a form of Depth-First Search (DFS), to explore all possible paths to see if one spells out the given word.

The core idea is to start a search from every cell. From a given cell, if the letter matches the current letter of the word we're looking for, we "mark" that cell as visited and recursively check its neighbors for the *next* letter of the word. If that path fails, we "unmark" the cell and backtrack to try another path.

Let's break down the code line by line with an example.

**Example:**

  * `board = [["A","B","C","E"], ["S","F","C","S"], ["A","D","E","E"]]`
  * `word = "ABCCED"`

-----

### **The `exist` (Outer) Function**

This function is the main driver that initiates the search.

```python
class Solution:
    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
```

This defines the main function that takes the `board` and the `word`.

```python
        # ... (dfs function definition) ...

        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
```

These nested loops iterate through every single cell (`i`, `j`) on the board, treating each one as a potential starting point for our word search.

```python
                if dfs(0, i, j):
                    return True
```

  * From each cell (`i`, `j`), it kicks off the recursive search by calling the `dfs` helper function.
  * `0`: We start by looking for the first character of the word (at index 0).
  * `i`, `j`: These are the coordinates of the starting cell.
  * If *any* of these starting calls to `dfs` returns `True`, it means we have found the word. There is no need to search further, so we immediately `return True`.

<!-- end list -->

```python
        return False
```

This line is only reached if the nested loops complete without any of the `dfs` calls ever returning `True`. This means the word could not be found starting from any cell, so we return `False`.

-----

### **The `dfs` (Inner Helper) Function**

This is the recursive engine that performs the backtracking search.

```python
        def dfs(idx, x, y):
```

  * `idx`: The index of the character in the `word` that we are currently searching for (e.g., if `idx=1`, we are looking for `word[1]`).
  * `x`, `y`: The coordinates of the cell on the `board` that we are currently examining.

#### **Base Case 1: Success**

```python
            if idx == len(word):
                return True
```

This is the successful stopping condition. If `idx` is equal to the length of the word, it means we have already successfully found all characters from `word[0]` to `word[len(word)-1]`. We have found a complete match, so we return `True`.

#### **Base Case 2: Failure**

```python
            if not (0 <= x < len(board) and 0 <= y < len(board[0])) or (board[x][y] != word[idx]):
                return False
```

This is the failure stopping condition, which checks two things:

1.  **Out of Bounds:** `not (0 <= x < ...)` checks if the current coordinates `(x, y)` are outside the grid.
2.  **Wrong Character:** `board[x][y] != word[idx]` checks if the letter in the current board cell does not match the character we are looking for.

If either of these is true, this path is invalid, so we stop exploring it and `return False`.

#### **The Backtracking Logic (Mark, Explore, Unmark)**

```python
            temp, board[x][y] = board[x][y], "/"
```

**1. Mark the Path:** This is a crucial step. To avoid using the same letter cell twice in one path, we must "mark" it as visited.

  * `temp = board[x][y]`: We store the original character of the cell in a `temp` variable.
  * `board[x][y] = "/"`: We overwrite the cell with a special character (like `/`) that won't match any letter in the word, effectively marking it as "in use" for the current path.

<!-- end list -->

```python
            for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                if dfs(idx + 1, x + dx, y + dy):
                    return True
```

**2. Explore Neighbors:** This loop explores the four adjacent cells (right, left, down, up).

  * It makes a new recursive call `dfs(...)` for each neighbor.
  * `idx + 1`: We are now looking for the *next* character in the word.
  * `x + dx, y + dy`: These are the coordinates of the neighbor cell.
  * If any of these four recursive calls returns `True`, it means a valid path was found from that neighbor. We don't need to check the other neighbors, so we immediately propagate the success by returning `True`.

<!-- end list -->

```python
            board[x][y] = temp
```

**3. Unmark the Path:** This line is only reached if the `for` loop above completes *without* any of the recursive calls returning `True`. This means the current cell was part of a dead end.

  * Before we return `False`, we **must restore the board to its original state**. We change the `"/"` back to its original letter (`temp`). This "unmarking" is essential so that other search paths (which might start from a different initial cell) are free to use this cell again.

<!-- end list -->

```python
            return False
```

If all four neighbor explorations resulted in failure, we conclude that no valid path can be formed through the current cell, so we `return False`.

### **Walkthrough with `word = "ABCCED"`**

1.  The outer `for` loops in `exist` start. Eventually, they call `dfs(idx=0, x=0, y=0)` on the top-left 'A'.
2.  **`dfs(0, 0, 0)`**:
      * `board[0][0]` ('A') matches `word[0]` ('A'). OK.
      * Mark `board[0][0]` as '/'.
      * Explore neighbors. One neighbor is at `(0, 1)`.
      * Call `dfs(idx=1, x=0, y=1)` for the letter 'B'.
3.  **`dfs(1, 0, 1)`**:
      * `board[0][1]` ('B') matches `word[1]` ('B'). OK.
      * Mark `board[0][1]` as '/'.
      * Explore neighbors. One neighbor is `(0, 2)`.
      * Call `dfs(idx=2, x=0, y=2)` for the letter 'C'.
4.  **`dfs(2, 0, 2)`**:
      * `board[0][2]` ('C') matches `word[2]` ('C'). OK.
      * Mark `board[0][2]` as '/'.
      * Explore neighbors. One neighbor is `(1, 2)`.
      * Call `dfs(idx=3, x=1, y=2)` for the next 'C'.
5.  ...This process continues successfully: `A -> B -> C -> C -> E -> D`.
6.  The call for `D` will be `dfs(5, 2, 1)`. It will succeed and then call `dfs(idx=6, ...)`.
7.  **`dfs(6, ...)`**:
      * **BASE CASE HIT\!** `idx` (6) is equal to `len(word)` (6).
      * It returns `True`.
8.  This `True` value propagates all the way back up the call stack. The `dfs(5, 2, 1)` call receives `True` and returns `True`. The `dfs(4, 2, 2)` call receives `True` and returns `True`, and so on.
9.  Finally, the initial `dfs(0, 0, 0)` call returns `True`.
10. The `if` statement in the `exist` function becomes `if True:`, and it immediately returns `True`.
