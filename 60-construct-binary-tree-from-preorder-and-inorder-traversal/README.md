Of course. This code reconstructs a unique binary tree from its `preorder` and `inorder` traversal sequences. This is a classic recursive "divide and conquer" algorithm.

The solution relies on two key properties of tree traversals:

1.  **Preorder Traversal (`Root, Left, Right`):** The very first element in a preorder sequence is *always* the root of the tree (or subtree).
2.  **Inorder Traversal (`Left, Root, Right`):** Once you know the root, all elements to its left in the inorder sequence belong to the left subtree, and all elements to its right belong to the right subtree.

Let's break down the code line by line with an example.

**Example:**

  * `preorder = [3, 9, 20, 15, 7]`
  * `inorder = [9, 3, 15, 20, 7]`

**Expected Tree:**

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

### **The `buildTree` Function**

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
```

This defines the function `buildTree` which takes the two lists and returns the `root` of the newly constructed tree.

#### **The Base Case**

```python
        if inorder:
```

  * **What it does:** This is the base case for the recursion. The code only proceeds if the `inorder` list for the current subtree is not empty. If it *is* empty, it means there are no nodes in this branch, and the function implicitly returns `None`. This `None` will be assigned to the parent's `.left` or `.right` attribute.

#### **Step 1: Find the Root**

```python
            inorder_index = inorder.index(preorder.pop(0))
```

This is the most important line, and it does two things at once:

1.  **`preorder.pop(0)`**: This **removes and returns** the first element from the `preorder` list. Based on the property of preorder traversal, this element is the **root of the current tree/subtree**. This action also consumes the `preorder` list, so the next element at index 0 will be the root of the next subtree to be processed.
2.  **`inorder.index(...)`**: It then takes this root value and finds its index within the current `inorder` list slice. This tells us where to split the `inorder` list into left and right subtrees.

**Tracing the first call (`preorder = [3, 9, 20, 15, 7]`, `inorder = [9, 3, 15, 20, 7]`):**

  * `preorder.pop(0)` removes and returns `3`.
  * The `preorder` list is now `[9, 20, 15, 7]`.
  * `inorder.index(3)` finds that `3` is at index `1` in the `inorder` list.
  * `inorder_index` is set to `1`.

#### **Step 2: Create the Root Node**

```python
            root = TreeNode(inorder[inorder_index])
```

A new `TreeNode` is created using the value we identified as the root. In our first call, this is `TreeNode(3)`.

#### **Step 3: Recursively Build the Left Subtree**

```python
            root.left = self.buildTree(preorder, inorder[:inorder_index])
```

  * **`root.left = ...`**: We are about to build the left child of our current root and assign it.
  * **`self.buildTree(...)`**: This is the recursive call to build the left subtree.
  * **`preorder`**: We pass the **modified** `preorder` list, which is now `[9, 20, 15, 7]`. The recursive call will pop the `9` from this.
  * **`inorder[:inorder_index]`**: We pass a slice of the `inorder` list containing everything to the *left* of the root. Since `inorder_index` was `1`, this slice is `inorder[:1]`, which is `[9]`.

#### **Step 4: Recursively Build the Right Subtree**

```python
            root.right = self.buildTree(preorder, inorder[inorder_index + 1:])
```

  * **`root.right = ...`**: Now we build and assign the right child.
  * **`self.buildTree(...)`**: Another recursive call.
  * **`preorder`**: We pass the `preorder` list, which has now been **further modified** by the left subtree's recursive call. It is now `[20, 15, 7]`.
  * **`inorder[inorder_index + 1:]`**: We pass a slice of the `inorder` list containing everything to the *right* of the root. Since `inorder_index` was `1`, this slice is `inorder[2:]`, which is `[15, 20, 7]`.

#### **Step 5: Return the Constructed Node**

```python
            return root
```

The function returns the `root` node it has just constructed, with its left and right subtrees correctly attached.

### **Visual Walkthrough**

1.  **`buildTree(pre=[3, 9, 20, 15, 7], in=[9, 3, 15, 20, 7])`**
      * Root value is `3`. `inorder_index` is `1`.
      * Creates `Node(3)`.
      * **Left Call:** `buildTree(pre=[9, 20, 15, 7], in=[9])`
          * Root value is `9`. `inorder_index` is `0`.
          * Creates `Node(9)`.
          * Left call passes `in=[]` -\> returns `None`. `Node(9).left` is `None`.
          * Right call passes `in=[]` -\> returns `None`. `Node(9).right` is `None`.
          * Returns `Node(9)`.
      * `Node(3).left` is now assigned `Node(9)`.
      * The `preorder` list is now `[20, 15, 7]` because `9` was consumed by the left call.
      * **Right Call:** `buildTree(pre=[20, 15, 7], in=[15, 20, 7])`
          * Root value is `20`. `inorder_index` is `1`.
          * Creates `Node(20)`.
          * **Left Call:** `buildTree(pre=[15, 7], in=[15])`
              * Root value is `15`. Creates `Node(15)`.
              * Its sub-calls return `None`.
              * Returns `Node(15)`.
          * `Node(20).left` is now `Node(15)`.
          * The `preorder` list is now `[7]`.
          * **Right Call:** `buildTree(pre=[7], in=[7])`
              * Root value is `7`. Creates `Node(7)`.
              * Returns `Node(7)`.
          * `Node(20).right` is now `Node(7)`.
          * Returns `Node(20)`.
      * `Node(3).right` is now assigned `Node(20)`.
      * The initial function call returns `Node(3)`, which is the root of the fully constructed tree.
