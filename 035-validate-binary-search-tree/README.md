This code determines if a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST) using a recursive approach with boundary constraints.

A Binary Search Tree has a specific set of rules:
1.  For any given node, all values in its **left** subtree must be **less than** the node's value.
2.  For any given node, all values in its **right** subtree must be **greater than** the node's value.
3.  Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

This code validates these rules not just for a node and its immediate children, but for all of its descendants.

Let's break down the code line by line with two examples: one valid and one invalid.
* **Valid Example:** A tree represented as `[2, 1, 3]`
    ```
      2
     / \
    1   3
    ```
* **Invalid Example:** A tree represented as `[5, 1, 4, null, null, 3, 6]`
    ```
          5
         / \
        1   4   <-- Rule 2 violated: 4 is not > 5
           / \
          3   6 <-- Rule 1 violated: 3 is not > 5
    ```

### **The `isValidBST` (Outer) Function**

This is the main, public-facing function that a user would call.

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
```
This defines the function `isValidBST` which takes the `root` of a binary tree as input.

```python
        # In Python, we use float('-inf') and float('inf') for infinity
        from math import inf
        return validate(root, -inf, inf)
```
This is the entry point to the recursive process. It calls the inner helper function `validate` with initial parameters:
* `root`: The root node of the tree we want to check.
* `-inf`: The initial lower bound. The root node can be any value, so its lower bound is negative infinity.
* `inf`: The initial upper bound. The root node's upper bound is positive infinity.

### **The `validate` (Inner Helper) Function**

This is the recursive engine that does all the work. It checks if a node and all its children fit within a valid range (`low`, `high`).

```python
        def validate(root, low, high):
```
* `root`: The current node we are examining.
* `low`: The lower boundary that the current node's value **must be greater than**.
* `high`: The upper boundary that the current node's value **must be less than**.

#### **The Base Case**
```python
            if not root:
                return True
```
This is the stopping condition for the recursion. An empty node (a `None` value) doesn't violate any BST rules, so we consider it valid. If we reach the end of a branch without finding any issues, this `True` value is returned.

#### **The Validation Step**
```python
            if not (low < root.val < high):
                return False
```
This is the core validation logic for the **current node**. It checks if the node's value (`root.val`) falls strictly between its allowed `low` and `high` boundaries. If it doesn't, we have found a violation. The function immediately returns `False`, and this `False` will propagate up the recursion chain.

#### **The Recursive Step**
```python
            return validate(root.left, low, root.val) and validate(root.right, root.val, high)
```
If the current node is valid, we then need to check its left and right subtrees. The `and` means that **both** subtrees must be valid for the whole tree to be valid.

* `validate(root.left, low, root.val)`: This is the recursive call for the **left child**.
    * `low`: The lower bound is passed down unchanged.
    * `root.val`: This is the crucial part. The left child's value can be anything greater than `low`, but it **must be less than its parent's value**. So, the parent's value (`root.val`) becomes the new **upper bound (`high`)** for the entire left subtree.

* `validate(root.right, root.val, high)`: This is the recursive call for the **right child**.
    * `root.val`: The right child's value must be **greater than its parent's value**. So, the parent's value (`root.val`) becomes the new **lower bound (`low`)** for the entire right subtree.
    * `high`: The upper bound is passed down unchanged.

### **Walkthrough with the Invalid Example: `[5, 1, 4, ..., 3, ...]`**

1.  **Initial Call:** `validate(Node(5), -inf, inf)`
    * `5` is between `-inf` and `inf`. OK.
    * Recursively checks its children.

2.  **Left Child Call:** `validate(Node(1), -inf, 5)` (The new upper bound is 5)
    * `1` is between `-inf` and `5`. OK.
    * Its children are `None`, so both recursive calls will return `True`. This branch is considered valid.

3.  **Right Child Call:** `validate(Node(4), 5, inf)` (The new lower bound is 5)
    * **VALIDATION FAILS!** The check `low < root.val < high` becomes `5 < 4 < inf`, which is **False**.
    * This call immediately returns `False`.

4.  **Final Result:** The initial call `validate(Node(5), ...)` was waiting for the results from its left and right children: `(True from left) and (False from right)`. The result of this `and` operation is **`False`**. The entire function returns `False`, correctly identifying the tree as invalid.
