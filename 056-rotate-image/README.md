Of course. This code generates all possible subsets (also known as the power set) from a given list of numbers. It uses a recursive technique called **backtracking** or Depth-First Search (DFS).

The core idea is to build subsets step by step. Starting with an empty subset, we iterate through the numbers. For each number, we have two choices: either include it in the current subset and explore further, or skip it and move to the next. This code implements that logic elegantly.

Let's break down the code line by line with an example.

**Example:** `nums = [1, 2, 3]`

-----

### **The `subsets` (Outer) Function**

This function is the main entry point that sets up the process.

```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
```

This defines the `subsets` function which takes the list of numbers `nums` and will return a list of lists, where each inner list is a unique subset.

```python
        result = []
```

An empty list `result` is created. This list will be populated by our recursive helper function with all the subsets we find.

```python
        dfs(0, [])
```

This is the initial call that "kicks off" the recursive process.

  * `0`: This is the `index` we will start from in the `nums` array.
  * `[]`: This is the `path` or the current subset we are building. We start with an empty subset.

<!-- end list -->

```python
        return result
```

After the `dfs` function has fully explored all possible combinations, the `result` list will be filled. This line returns that final list. For `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, the expected result is `[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]`.

-----

### **The `dfs` (Recursive Helper) Function**

This is the recursive engine that does the actual work of building the subsets.

```python
        def dfs(index, path):
```

  * `index`: This integer tells the function where to start looking for numbers in the `nums` list for the *current* level of recursion. This is crucial for avoiding duplicate subsets.
  * `path`: This list is the subset that has been constructed so far on the current recursive path.

#### **Adding the Current Subset**

```python
            result.append(path)
```

This is the first action inside `dfs`. Unlike some other backtracking problems, **every path we are on is a valid subset**. The initial empty path `[]` is a subset, the path `[1]` is a subset, the path `[1, 2]` is a subset, and so on. So, as soon as we enter the function, we add the current `path` to our `result` list.

#### **The Recursive Exploration Loop**

```python
            for i in range(index, len(nums)):
```

This loop iterates through the numbers in `nums`, but it importantly starts from the `index` that was passed into the function. This prevents us from going backward and creating duplicate subsets (e.g., after considering `[1, 2]`, we don't want to consider `[1, 2, 1]`).

```python
                dfs(i + 1, path + [nums[i]])
```

This is the recursive call where the function calls itself to explore deeper. Let's break down the arguments it passes to the next level:

1.  **`i + 1`**: This is the new `index`. After we've decided to include the number `nums[i]` in our current path, we tell the next recursive call that it should only consider numbers starting from the *next* position (`i + 1`). This is what ensures that elements in a subset are unique and in increasing order of their original index.
2.  **`path + [nums[i]]`**: This creates a **new list** for the next `path` by adding the element we just chose (`nums[i]`) to the end of the current `path`.

### **Visual Walkthrough with `nums = [1, 2, 3]`**

Let's trace the execution to see how the subsets are generated.

**1. Initial call:** `dfs(index=0, path=[])`

  - `result.append([])`. **result is `[[]]`**.
  - Loop `i` from 0 to 2.

**2. `i = 0` (Choose `1`):** Call `dfs(index=1, path=[1])`

  - `result.append([1])`. **result is `[[], [1]]`**.
  - Loop `i` from 1 to 2.

**3. `i = 1` (Choose `2`):** Call `dfs(index=2, path=[1, 2])`

  - `result.append([1, 2])`. **result is `[[], [1], [1, 2]]`**.
  - Loop `i` from 2 to 2.

**4. `i = 2` (Choose `3`):** Call `dfs(index=3, path=[1, 2, 3])`

  - `result.append([1, 2, 3])`. **result is `[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3]]`**.
  - Loop `i` from 3 to 2. The loop is empty.
  - `dfs(3, ...)` returns.

**5. Back in `dfs(2, [1, 2])`**: The loop is finished. It returns.

**6. Back in `dfs(1, [1])`**: The loop continues.

  - **`i = 2` (Choose `3`):** Call `dfs(index=3, path=[1, 3])`
      - `result.append([1, 3])`. **result is `[..., [1, 3]]`**.
      - Loop `i` from 3 to 2 is empty.
      - `dfs(3, ...)` returns.
  - The loop is finished. `dfs(1, [1])` returns.

**7. Back in the initial call `dfs(0, [])`**: The loop continues.

  - **`i = 1` (Choose `2`):** Call `dfs(index=2, path=[2])`
      - `result.append([2])`. **result is `[..., [2]]`**.
      - Loop `i` from 2 to 2.
      - **`i = 2` (Choose `3`):** Call `dfs(index=3, path=[2, 3])`
          - `result.append([2, 3])`. **result is `[..., [2, 3]]`**.
          - Loop `i` from 3 to 2 is empty. Returns.
      - Loop finishes. Returns.

**8. Back in the initial call `dfs(0, [])`**: The loop continues.

  - **`i = 2` (Choose `3`):** Call `dfs(index=3, path=[3])`
      - `result.append([3])`. **result is `[..., [3]]`**.
      - Loop `i` from 3 to 2 is empty. Returns.
  - The loop finishes. The initial call returns.

The `subsets` function now returns the final `result` list containing all 8 subsets.
