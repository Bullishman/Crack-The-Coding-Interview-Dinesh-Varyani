This code implements the well-known algorithm for finding the "next permutation" of a sequence of numbers in lexicographical (dictionary) order. It's a clever three-step process that modifies the list in-place.

Let's break down the logic line by line using two examples:
* **Main Example:** `nums = [1, 3, 5, 4, 2]`
* **Edge Case Example:** `nums = [3, 2, 1]`

The goal is to rearrange the numbers to form the very next greater number possible. For `[1, 3, 5, 4, 2]`, the next permutation should be `[1, 4, 2, 3, 5]`.

### **Initial Setup**

```python
class Solution:
    def nextPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(nums)
        i = n - 2
```
* `n = len(nums)`: Gets the total number of elements in the list. For our main example, `n = 5`.
* `i = n - 2`: Initializes a pointer `i` to the second-to-last element. This is where we will start scanning from right to left. For our main example, `i` starts at index `3` (the element `4`).

---

### **Step 1: Find the Breakpoint**

The goal of this step is to find the first number from the right that is smaller than the number to its right. This number is our "pivot" or "breakpoint" because everything to its right is in descending order (the highest possible permutation for that suffix), so we must change the pivot to get a larger overall permutation.

```python
        # Step 1: Find the breakpoint
        while i >= 0 and nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]:
            i -= 1
```
* The `while` loop moves `i` to the left as long as two conditions are met:
    1.  `i >= 0`: We haven't fallen off the left end of the list.
    2.  `nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]`: The number at `i` is greater than or equal to its neighbor on the right. This indicates we are in a descending (or non-increasing) part of the sequence.

**Tracing with `nums = [1, 3, 5, 4, 2]`:**
1.  **`i = 3`**: `nums[3]` (4) is greater than `nums[4]` (2). The condition is true. Decrement `i`. `i` becomes `2`.
2.  **`i = 2`**: `nums[2]` (5) is greater than `nums[3]` (4). The condition is true. Decrement `i`. `i` becomes `1`.
3.  **`i = 1`**: `nums[1]` (3) is **less than** `nums[2]` (5). The condition `nums[i] >= nums[i+1]` is now **false**. The loop stops.

* **Result of Step 1:** The loop finishes with `i = 1`. This is our breakpoint. The element `nums[1]` (which is `3`) is the number we need to change.

---

### **Step 2: Find Successor and Swap**

Now that we have our pivot `nums[i]`, we need to swap it with the smallest number in the suffix to its right that is *still larger* than the pivot.

```python
        if i >= 0:
```
This check is important. If the entire list was in descending order (like `[3, 2, 1]`), the `while` loop in Step 1 would make `i` become `-1`. This `if` block would be skipped, and we would proceed directly to Step 3. For our main example, `i` is `1`, so we enter this block.

```python
            # Step 2: Find the smallest element larger than nums[i]
            j = n - 1
            while nums[j] <= nums[i]:
                j -= 1
```
* We start a new pointer `j` at the far right end of the list.
* We move `j` to the left until we find an element `nums[j]` that is strictly greater than our pivot `nums[i]`. Because the suffix `nums[i+1:]` (`[5, 4, 2]`) is sorted in descending order, the first element we find that is larger will also be the smallest possible successor.

**Tracing with our example (`i = 1`, `nums[i] = 3`):**
1.  **`j = 4`**: `nums[4]` (2) is not greater than `nums[1]` (3). The condition `nums[j] <= nums[i]` is true. Decrement `j`. `j` becomes `3`.
2.  **`j = 3`**: `nums[3]` (4) **is greater than** `nums[1]` (3). The condition is now **false**. The loop stops.

* **Result:** `j = 3`. The element `nums[3]` (which is `4`) is the one we will swap with.

```python
            # Swap nums[i] and nums[j]
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
```
We swap the elements at indices `i` and `j`.

**In our example:**
* `nums` was `[1, 3, 5, 4, 2]`
* Swap `nums[1]` (3) and `nums[3]` (4).
* `nums` becomes `[1, 4, 5, 3, 2]`

### **Step 3: Reverse the Suffix**

After the swap, the prefix `[1, 4]` is now correct for the next permutation. However, the suffix `[5, 3, 2]` is in descending order, which is the largest possible permutation for these three numbers. To get the *very next* overall permutation, we need to make this suffix as small as possible. The smallest permutation is when the numbers are sorted in ascending order. We can achieve this by simply reversing the descending suffix.

```python
        # Step 3: Reverse the subarray to the right of i
        nums[i + 1:] = reversed(nums[i + 1:])
```
* This line takes the slice of the list starting from the element *after* our pivot `i`.
* It reverses that slice in-place.

**In our example:**
* The slice `nums[i + 1:]` is `nums[2:]`, which is `[5, 3, 2]`.
* Reversing this gives `[2, 3, 5]`.
* The final state of `nums` is `[1, 4, 2, 3, 5]`. This is the correct next permutation.

---

### **Edge Case Example: `nums = [3, 2, 1]`**

1.  **Step 1:** The `while` loop starts with `i = 1`. `nums[1]` (2) > `nums[2]` (1). `i` becomes `0`. `nums[0]` (3) > `nums[1]` (2). `i` becomes `-1`. The loop stops. `i = -1`.
2.  **Step 2:** The condition `if i >= 0` is **false**. This block is skipped.
3.  **Step 3:** The reversal is applied to `nums[i + 1:]`, which is `nums[0:]` (the whole list).
    * Reversing `[3, 2, 1]` gives `[1, 2, 3]`.
* This correctly handles the case where the input is the last possible permutation, wrapping around to the first one (the sorted list).
