Of course. This code solves the "Jump Game II" problem, which asks for the minimum number of jumps to reach the final index of an array.

The algorithm is a highly efficient **greedy approach**. You can think of it like a Breadth-First Search (BFS) on the array indices. Each "jump" represents exploring a new "level" of reachable indices. The code always tries to find the farthest possible reach from its current level to minimize the total number of jumps.

Let's break it down line by line with an example.

**Example:** `nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]`
**Goal:** Find the minimum jumps to get from index 0 to the last index (index 4). The answer should be 2 (e.g., jump from index 0 to 1, then from index 1 to 4).

### **The `jump` Function**

```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
```

This defines the main function that takes the list `nums`.

#### **The Edge Case**

```python
        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return 0
```

  * **What it does:** This handles the simple case where the array has only one element or is empty. In this situation, you are already at the end, so 0 jumps are needed.

#### **Variable Initialization**

```python
        jump_count = 0
        current_reach = 0
        max_reach = 0
```

  * **`jump_count`**: This will count the number of jumps we've made. It starts at 0.
  * **`current_reach`**: This marks the farthest index we can get to with the *current* number of jumps. It's the boundary of our current "level". It starts at 0.
  * **`max_reach`**: This tracks the absolute farthest we can get by making *one more* jump from any position within our current level. It also starts at 0.

-----

### **The Main Loop**

```python
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
```

  * **What it does:** This loop iterates through each index `i` of the array, but stops at the **second-to-last** element.
  * **Why:** We only need to decide *from* which index to jump. Once we are at an index that can reach or pass the final index, our job is done, and we don't need to consider jumping *from* the final index.

#### **Updating the Maximum Reach**

```python
            max_reach = max(max_reach, i + nums[i])
```

  * **What it does:** At our current position `i`, the farthest we can jump to is `i + nums[i]`. This line checks if this new potential reach is better than the `max_reach` we've found so far from other positions in our current level. It always keeps track of the best possible next landing spot.

#### **Making a Jump**

```python
            if i == current_reach:
                jump_count += 1
                current_reach = max_reach
```

  * **What it does:** This is the most important part of the algorithm. The condition `i == current_reach` means our iterator `i` has just reached the boundary of the area reachable by our previous jump.
  * **Why:** Once we hit this boundary, it means we have explored all the possibilities within the current jump's range. To go further, we are now forced to commit to another jump.
      * `jump_count += 1`: We increment our jump counter.
      * `current_reach = max_reach`: We set the boundary for our *new* jump. The farthest we can now reach is the `max_reach` we calculated while exploring the previous level.

#### **The Early Exit Optimization**

```python
                if current_reach >= len(nums) - 1:
                    return jump_count
```

  * **What it does:** After we've updated `current_reach`, we check if this new reach is enough to get to or past the final index.
  * **Why:** If it is, we have found our minimum number of jumps. There's no need to continue the loop, so we can return the `jump_count` immediately.

<!-- end list -->

```python
        return jump_count
```

This final return handles cases where the loop completes without the early exit.

### **Live Trace with `nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]`**

Last index is `4`. `k=2`
**Initial State:** `jump_count = 0`, `current_reach = 0`, `max_reach = 0`

| `i` | `nums[i]` | `i + nums[i]` | `max_reach` (after update) | `i == current_reach`? | Action | `jump_count` | `current_reach` |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:--- |:---:|:---:|
| **0** | 2 | 2 | `max(0, 2) = 2` | Yes (0 == 0) | Jump\! `current_reach` becomes 2. | 1 | 2 |
| **1** | 3 | 4 | `max(2, 4) = 4` | No (1 \!= 2) | | 1 | 2 |
| **2** | 1 | 3 | `max(4, 3) = 4` | Yes (2 == 2) | Jump\! `current_reach` becomes 4. Early exit `4>=4` is TRUE. **Return `jump_count`**. | **2** | 4 |

The function returns **2**. Let's analyze what happened:

1.  **At `i = 0`**: We are at the start. The farthest we can see is index 2 (`max_reach = 2`). Since we are at the end of our initial "level" (where `i = current_reach = 0`), we must make our **first jump**. Our new goal is to reach anywhere up to index 2 (`current_reach` is updated to 2). `jump_count` is now 1.
2.  **At `i = 1`**: We are within the range of our first jump. From here, we can reach index `1 + 3 = 4`. This is better than our previous `max_reach` of 2, so we update `max_reach` to 4.
3.  **At `i = 2`**: We have reached the boundary of our first jump (`i == current_reach`). This means we must commit to our **second jump**. The new `current_reach` becomes the `max_reach` we just found, which is 4. `jump_count` is now 2. We check the early exit condition: `current_reach` (4) is \>= the last index (4). This is true, so we immediately return `jump_count`, which is 2.
