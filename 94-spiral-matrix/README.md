Of course. This code provides a solution for traversing a matrix in spiral order.

### The Core Idea

This approach is very intuitive. It works by "peeling" the outer layer of the matrix in a `while` loop, processing one direction at a time, until the matrix is empty.

1.  **Go Right:** Peel off the top row.
2.  **Go Down:** Peel off the rightmost column.
3.  **Go Left:** Peel off the bottom row.
4.  **Go Up:** Peel off the leftmost column.

This process repeats on the smaller, inner matrix that remains. The code uses destructive list methods like `.pop()` to modify the matrix as it's being processed.

Let's break down the code line by line with an example.

**Example:**

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4],
          [5, 6, 7, 8],
          [9, 10, 11, 12]]
```

**Expected Final Result:** `[1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 11, 10, 9, 5, 6, 7]`

### **Initial Setup**

```python
class Solution:
    def spiralOrder(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
```

  * `result = []`: An empty list is created to store the numbers in their final spiral order.

### **The Main Loop**

```python
        while matrix:
```

  * This loop continues as long as the `matrix` contains any rows. An empty list `[]` evaluates to `False` in Python, so the loop stops once the matrix is empty.

### **Inside the Loop: The Four Traversal Steps**

#### **Step 1: Traverse Right**

```python
            result += matrix.pop(0) # 1
```

  * **What it does:** This line handles the entire top-to-bottom traversal in one go.
  * `matrix.pop(0)`: This removes and returns the **first row** from the matrix.
  * `result += ...`: This extends the `result` list with all the elements from the row we just popped.
  * **After this line in the first iteration:**
      * `result` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
      * `matrix` is now `[[5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]]`.

#### **Step 2: Traverse Down**

```python
            if matrix and matrix[0]: # 2 
                for line in matrix:
                    result.append(line.pop())
```

  * **`if matrix and matrix[0]:`**: This is a crucial safety check. We only proceed if the matrix still has rows AND the first of the remaining rows is not empty.
  * **`for line in matrix:`**: This loop iterates through all the *remaining* rows.
  * **`result.append(line.pop())`**: For each row, `.pop()` removes and returns the **last element**. This effectively peels off the rightmost column from top to bottom.
  * **After this block in the first iteration:**
      * The loop takes `8` from the first row and `12` from the second.
      * `result` is now `[1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12]`.
      * `matrix` is now `[[5, 6, 7], [9, 10, 11]]`.

#### **Step 3: Traverse Left**

```python
            if matrix: # 3
                result += matrix.pop()[::-1]
```

  * **`if matrix:`**: Another safety check to ensure there's still a row left to process.
  * **`matrix.pop()`**: This removes and returns the **last row** of the remaining matrix (which is now the bottom row).
  * **`[::-1]`**: This reverses the row we just popped. Since we want to traverse from right to left, this is a concise way to add the elements in the correct order.
  * **After this line in the first iteration:**
      * `matrix.pop()` removes `[9, 10, 11]`.
      * `[::-1]` reverses it to `[11, 10, 9]`.
      * `result` is now `[1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 11, 10, 9]`.
      * `matrix` is now `[[5, 6, 7]]`.

#### **Step 4: Traverse Up**

```python
            if matrix and matrix[0]: # 4
                for line in matrix[::-1]:
                    result.append(line.pop(0))
```

  * **`if matrix and matrix[0]:`**: The final safety check.
  * **`for line in matrix[::-1]:`**: This iterates through the remaining rows in **reverse order** (from bottom to top).
  * **`result.append(line.pop(0))`**: For each row, `.pop(0)` removes and returns the **first element**. This peels off the leftmost column from bottom to top.
  * **After this block in the first iteration:**
      * The loop only has one row `[5, 6, 7]`.
      * It takes the first element, `5`.
      * `result` is now `[1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 11, 10, 9, 5]`.
      * `matrix` is now `[[6, 7]]`.

The first `while` loop iteration is now complete. The process repeats with the smaller inner matrix.

### **Live Trace Table Map**

This table shows the state of the `matrix` and `result` at the start of each `while` loop iteration and the changes within.

| Iteration | `matrix` (at start) | Actions within the Loop | `result` (at end) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | `[[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]` | **1 (Right):** Pop `[1,2,3,4]`. \<br\> **2 (Down):** Pop `8`, then `12`. \<br\> **3 (Left):** Pop `[9,10,11]`, add as `[11,10,9]`. \<br\> **4 (Up):** Pop `5`. | `[1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5]` |
| **2** | `[[6, 7]]` | **1 (Right):** Pop `[6,7]`. \<br\> **2 (Down):** `if` fails, matrix is now empty. \<br\> **3 (Left):** `if` fails. \<br\> **4 (Up):** `if` fails. | `[1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]` |

At this point, `matrix` is `[]`, so the `while matrix:` condition becomes `False`, and the loop terminates. The function returns the final `result`.
