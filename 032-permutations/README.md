This code generates all possible permutations of a list of numbers using a recursive technique called **backtracking**, which is a form of Depth-First Search (DFS).

Let's break down the code line by line using a simple example.

**Example:** `nums = [1, 2, 3]`

The goal is to generate all possible orderings: `[1,2,3]`, `[1,3,2]`, `[2,1,3]`, `[2,3,1]`, `[3,1,2]`, and `[3,2,1]`.

### **The Main Function: `permute`**

This is the entry point that sets up the process.

```python
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
```
This defines the main function `permute` that takes the list of numbers `nums` and is expected to return a list of lists, where each inner list is a unique permutation.

```python
        ans = []
```
An empty list `ans` is initialized. This list will be used to store all the complete permutations as we find them.

```python
        self.dfs(nums, [], ans)
```
This is the initial call to our recursive helper function, `dfs`. It "kicks off" the search for permutations.
* `nums`: We pass the full original list `[1, 2, 3]` as the pool of available numbers to use.
* `[]`: We pass an empty list `[]` because our current permutation is just beginning; we haven't picked any numbers yet.
* `ans`: We pass the `ans` list so the helper function can add results to it.

```python
        return ans
```
After the `dfs` function has run and completely explored all possibilities, the `ans` list will be full. This line returns that final list.

### **The Recursive Helper Function: `dfs`**

This is where the real magic happens. `dfs` stands for Depth-First Search. Think of it as a worker that explores one path at a time.

```python
    def dfs(self, nums, temp_nums, ans):
```
* `nums`: The numbers that are *still available* to be picked.
* `temp_nums`: The permutation we are *currently building*.
* `ans`: The final list to store completed permutations.

#### **The Base Case (When to stop a path)**

```python
        if not nums:
            ans.append(temp_nums)
            return
```
This is the **base case** of the recursion. It checks if the list of available numbers (`nums`) is empty.
* If `nums` is empty, it means we have successfully used every number from the original list to build the permutation currently in `temp_nums`.
* `ans.append(temp_nums)`: The complete permutation `temp_nums` is added to our final `ans` list.
* `return`: We stop going down this path and return to the previous function call to explore other options.

#### **The Recursive Step (Exploring all choices)**

```python
        for i in range(len(nums)):
```
If the list of available numbers is not empty, we loop through every number `nums[i]` that is currently available. For each of these numbers, we will try adding it to our permutation.

```python
            self.dfs(nums[:i] + nums[i + 1:], temp_nums + [nums[i]], ans)
```
This is the recursive call where the function calls itself to go one level deeper. Let's break down the arguments it passes:

1.  **`nums[:i] + nums[i + 1:]`**: This is the "choose" step. It creates a **new list** of available numbers by removing the number we just picked (`nums[i]`).
2.  **`temp_nums + [nums[i]]`**: This is the "explore" step. It creates a **new list** for the current permutation by adding the number we just chose (`nums[i]`) to the end of it.
3.  **`ans`**: The reference to the results list is passed down.

### **Walkthrough with `nums = [1, 2, 3]`**

Let's trace the first few steps to see how `[1, 2, 3]` and `[1, 3, 2]` are found.

**1. `permute([1, 2, 3])` calls `dfs(nums=[1, 2, 3], temp_nums=[], ans=[])`**

* The `for` loop starts. `i = 0`. The chosen number is `1`.
* It calls **`dfs(nums=[2, 3], temp_nums=[1], ans=[])`**.

**2. Inside `dfs(nums=[2, 3], temp_nums=[1], ...)`**

* `nums` is not empty. The `for` loop starts.
* **Path 1: `i = 0`**. The chosen number is `2`.
    * It calls **`dfs(nums=[3], temp_nums=[1, 2], ans=[])`**.
        * Inside this call, the `for` loop runs once. `i = 0`. The chosen number is `3`.
        * It calls **`dfs(nums=[], temp_nums=[1, 2, 3], ans=[])`**.
            * **BASE CASE HIT!** `nums` is empty.
            * `ans.append([1, 2, 3])`. Now `ans` is `[[1, 2, 3]]`.
            * It returns.
    * The call for `temp_nums=[1, 2]` is now finished with its loop. It returns.
* **Path 2: `i = 1`**. The chosen number is `3`.
    * It calls **`dfs(nums=[2], temp_nums=[1, 3], ans=[[1, 2, 3]])`**.
        * Inside this call, the `for` loop runs once. `i = 0`. The chosen number is `2`.
        * It calls **`dfs(nums=[], temp_nums=[1, 3, 2], ans=[[1, 2, 3]])`**.
            * **BASE CASE HIT!** `nums` is empty.
            * `ans.append([1, 3, 2])`. Now `ans` is `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2]]`.
            * It returns.
    * The call for `temp_nums=[1, 3]` is now finished with its loop. It returns.
* Now the call for `temp_nums=[1]` is finished. It returns.

**3. Back in the first call `dfs(nums=[1, 2, 3], ...)`**

* The loop continues. `i = 1`. The chosen number is `2`.
* It calls **`dfs(nums=[1, 3], temp_nums=[2], ...)`** and this entire process repeats, eventually finding the permutations `[2, 1, 3]` and `[2, 3, 1]`.

This continues until all possibilities have been explored and the `ans` list contains all 6 permutations.
