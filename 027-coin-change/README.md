This is a classic dynamic programming problem. Let's break down the code's logic step-by-step using two different examples to see how it behaves.

**Example 1 (Impossible Case):** `coins = [2]`, `amount = 3`
**Example 2 (Successful Case):** `coins = [1, 2, 5]`, `amount = 11`

***

### **1. Function Definition**

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
```

This defines the function `coinChange`. It takes a list of available coin denominations (`coins`) and the target `amount` to make. It will return the minimum number of coins needed, or -1 if it's impossible.

***

### **2. DP Array Initialization**

```python
        dp = [0] + [amount + 1] * amount
```

This line creates a list (our "DP table") to store the answers to subproblems.
* `dp[i]` will hold the minimum number of coins required to make an amount of `i`.
* The list is sized `amount + 1` to hold values for amounts 0 through `amount`.
* **`[0]`**: `dp[0]` is set to `0` because it takes 0 coins to make an amount of 0.
* **`[amount + 1] * amount`**: The rest of the list is filled with a placeholder value of `amount + 1`. This number is chosen because it's guaranteed to be larger than any possible valid answer. It effectively represents "infinity" or an unsolved state.

**For Example 1 (`amount = 3`):**
* `dp` is initialized to `[0, 4, 4, 4]`

**For Example 2 (`amount = 11`):**
* `dp` is initialized to `[0, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12]`

### **3. Outer Loop: Iterating Through Each Coin**

```python
        for coin in coins:
```

The code iterates through each coin denomination provided in the `coins` list. For each coin, it will try to update the `dp` table to see if using this coin can create a better (smaller) solution for any amount.

***

### **4. Inner Loop: Iterating Through Amounts**

```python
            for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
```

For each `coin`, this inner loop goes through the amounts `i` from `coin` up to the target `amount`. It's pointless to check amounts smaller than the current coin's value (e.g., you can't use a 5-cent coin to make 3 cents), so the loop starts at `coin`.

***

### **5. The Core DP Logic**

```python
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
```

This is the most important line. For each amount `i`, it calculates the minimum number of coins needed by comparing two possibilities:

1.  `dp[i]`: The current minimum number of coins we already found for amount `i`. (This could still be the "infinity" placeholder).
2.  `dp[i - coin] + 1`: A new potential solution. The logic is: "If I use the current `coin`, the number of coins will be `1` (for this coin) plus the minimum number of coins needed for the rest of the amount, which is `i - coin`." We look up that value in our `dp` table at `dp[i - coin]`.

The code sets `dp[i]` to whichever of these two options is smaller.

### **Trace for Example 2: `coins = [1, 2, 5]`, `amount = 11`**

**Initial `dp`:** `[0, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12]`

---
**`coin = 1`**
* `dp[1] = min(12, dp[0]+1) = 1`
* `dp[2] = min(12, dp[1]+1) = 2`
* ...and so on up to `dp[11] = 11`.
* **`dp` becomes:** `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`

---
**`coin = 2`**
* `dp[2] = min(2, dp[0]+1) = 1` (Using one 2-coin is better than two 1-coins)
* `dp[3] = min(3, dp[1]+1) = 2` (Using one 1-coin and one 2-coin is better)
* `dp[4] = min(4, dp[2]+1) = 2` (Using two 2-coins is better)
* ...and so on.
* **`dp` becomes:** `[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6]`

---
**`coin = 5`**
* `dp[5] = min(3, dp[0]+1) = 1` (One 5-coin is best)
* `dp[6] = min(3, dp[1]+1) = 2` (One 1-coin + one 5-coin)
* `dp[7] = min(3, dp[2]+1) = 2` (One 2-coin + one 5-coin)
* ...
* `dp[10] = min(5, dp[5]+1) = 2` (Two 5-coins)
* `dp[11] = min(6, dp[6]+1) = min(6, 2+1) = 3` (One 5-coin + `dp[6]` which is 2 coins)
* **Final `dp`:** `[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3]`

***

### **6. Return the Final Result**

```python
        return -1 if dp[amount] == amount + 1 else dp[amount]
```

After all loops finish, the answer for the target `amount` is in `dp[amount]`.
* `if dp[amount] == amount + 1`: This checks if the value for our target amount is still the "infinity" placeholder. If it is, it means no combination of coins could make that amount. The function returns `-1`.
* `else dp[amount]`: If the value has been updated, it means a solution was found. The function returns this minimum value.

**For Example 1 (`amount = 3`):**
* The loop for `coin = 2` runs for `i=2` and `i=3`.
* `dp[2] = min(4, dp[0]+1) = 1`.
* `dp[3] = min(4, dp[1]+1)`. But `dp[1]` is still `4`. So `dp[3]` remains `4`.
* The final `dp` is `[0, 4, 1, 4]`.
* `dp[3]` is `4`, which equals `amount + 1`. The function returns **-1**.

**For Example 2 (`amount = 11`):**
* The final value of `dp[11]` is `3`.
* `3` is not equal to `12`. The function returns **3**. (Correct, as 5+5+1=11).
