Of course. This code solves the "Decode Ways" problem, which asks for the number of ways a string of digits can be decoded into letters based on the mapping A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26.

The solution uses **Dynamic Programming**. The core idea is that the number of ways to decode a string of length `i` can be calculated from the number of ways to decode shorter prefixes of that string.

### The Core Idea

Let `dp[i]` be the number of ways to decode the prefix of the string `s` with length `i` (i.e., `s[0...i-1]`).

To calculate `dp[i]`, we look at the last digit(s):

1.  **Single-Digit Decode:** If the last digit (`s[i-1]`) is a valid letter (i.e., '1'-'9'), we can form decodings by appending this letter to all possible decodings of the string `s[0...i-2]`. The number of ways to do this is `dp[i-1]`.
2.  **Two-Digit Decode:** If the last two digits (`s[i-2:i]`) form a valid letter (i.e., a number from '10' to '26'), we can form decodings by appending this two-digit letter to all possible decodings of the string `s[0...i-3]`. The number of ways to do this is `dp[i-2]`.

The total ways, `dp[i]`, is the sum of these two possibilities.

Let's break down the code line by line with an example.

**Example:** `s = "226"`
**Possible Decodings:**

  * `2, 2, 6`  -\> "BBF"
  * `22, 6`    -\> "VF"
  * `2, 26`    -\> "BZ"
    **Expected Result:** `3`

### **Initial Setup and Edge Case**

```python
class Solution:
    def numDecodings(self, s: str) -> int:
```

This defines the main function.

```python
        if s[0] == '0':
            return 0
```

  * **What it does:** This is a crucial edge case check. A string starting with '0' is invalid because no letter maps to '0' or '01', '02', etc.
  * **For our example `s = "226"`:** This check passes.

#### **DP Table Initialization**

```python
        dp = [0] * (len(s) + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
```

  * **`dp = [0] * (len(s) + 1)`**: This creates our DP table, which is a list of size `len(s) + 1`. `dp[i]` will store the number of ways to decode the prefix of `s` of length `i`.
  * **`dp[0] = 1`**: This is our base case. There is exactly **one** way to decode an empty string (the empty decoding). This is essential for the logic to work. For instance, when we calculate the ways to decode "2", we look back at the ways to decode "" and add the single letter 'B'.

**For our example, `s` has length 3, so `dp` is initialized as:** `[1, 0, 0, 0]`

### **The Main Loop: Filling the DP Table**

```python
        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
```

This loop iterates from `i = 1` up to the length of the string. In each iteration, it calculates the value for `dp[i]`.

#### **Case 1: Single-Digit Decoding**

```python
            if s[i - 1] != '0':
                dp[i] += dp[i - 1]
```

  * **`s[i - 1]`**: This gets the i-th character of the string (the last character of the current prefix `s[0:i]`).
  * **`if s[i - 1] != '0'`**: We check if this digit is valid for a single-character decoding ('1' through '9').
  * **`dp[i] += dp[i - 1]`**: If it is valid, we can form new decodings. The number of new decodings is simply the number of ways the string could be formed right before this character. So, we add the value of `dp[i-1]` to `dp[i]`.

#### **Case 2: Two-Digit Decoding**

```python
            if i >= 2 and 10 <= int(s[i - 2:i]) <= 26:
                dp[i] += dp[i - 2]
```

  * **`if i >= 2 ...`**: We can only consider a two-digit decoding if our prefix is at least two characters long.
  * **`10 <= int(s[i - 2:i]) <= 26`**: This checks if the last two digits form a number between 10 and 26, which is a valid two-digit letter mapping.
  * **`dp[i] += dp[i - 2]`**: If it is valid, we can also form decodings using this two-digit number. The number of ways to do this is equal to the number of ways the string could be formed right before these two characters. So, we add the value of `dp[i-2]` to `dp[i]`.

-----

### **Final Result**

```python
        return dp[-1]
```

After the loop finishes, `dp[len(s)]` (which can be accessed with `dp[-1]`) contains the total number of ways to decode the entire string.

### **Live Trace Table Map for `s = "226"`**

**Initial State:** `dp = [1, 0, 0, 0]`

| `i` | Current Prefix | `s[i-1]` | Single-Digit Check | `s[i-2:i]` | Two-Digit Check | `dp[i]` (Final) | `dp` Array State |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:--- |:---:|:--- |:---:|:--- |
| **1** | `"2"` | `'2'` | **Pass** (`'2' != '0'`). \<br\> `dp[1] += dp[0] = 0 + 1 = 1` | `n/a` | Fail (`i < 2`) | **1** | `[1, 1, 0, 0]` |
| **2** | `"22"` | `'2'` | **Pass** (`'2' != '0'`). \<br\> `dp[2] += dp[1] = 0 + 1 = 1` | `"22"` | **Pass** (`10 <= 22 <= 26`). \<br\> `dp[2] += dp[0] = 1 + 1 = 2` | **2** | `[1, 1, 2, 0]` |
| **3** | `"226"` | `'6'` | **Pass** (`'6' != '0'`). \<br\> `dp[3] += dp[2] = 0 + 2 = 2` | `"26"` | **Pass** (`10 <= 26 <= 26`). \<br\> `dp[3] += dp[1] = 2 + 1 = 3` | **3** | `[1, 1, 2, 3]` |

The loop finishes. The function returns `dp[-1]`, which is `dp[3]`, so the final answer is **3**.
