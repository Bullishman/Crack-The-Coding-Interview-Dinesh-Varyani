This code solves the "Jump Game" problem. The goal is to determine if you can reach the last index of an array starting from the first index, where each element represents the maximum number of steps you can jump forward from that position.

Let's use a new example to walk through it: `nums = [1, 2, 0, 1]`

The array has 4 elements (indices 0, 1, 2, 3). We want to see if we can reach index 3.

***

### **1. Function Definition**

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
```

This defines the function `canJump`. It takes the list `nums` as input and is expected to return `True` or `False`.

***

### **2. Initializing the Farthest Reach**

```python
        max_index = 0
```

A variable `max_index` is created. Think of this as your "frontier" or the farthest index you are currently able to reach. You start at index 0, so your initial frontier is 0.

**In our example:** `max_index` is set to `0`.

***

### **3. Looping Through Positions**

```python
        for i in range(len(nums)):
```

This loop iterates through each index `i` of the array, one by one. The variable `i` represents your current position.

**In our example:** The loop will run for `i = 0`, `i = 1`, `i = 2`, and `i = 3`.

***

### **4. The "Can I Be Here?" Check**

```python
            if i > max_index:
                return False
```

This is the key check. At each position `i`, the code asks: "Is my current position `i` beyond my established frontier (`max_index`)?" If it is, it means you've hit a gap you couldn't jump over, making it impossible to proceed. The function immediately stops and returns `False`.

***

### **5. Updating the Frontier**

```python
            max_index = max(max_index, nums[i] + i)
```

If you *can* be at the current position `i`, you now have the opportunity to jump from it.
* `nums[i] + i` calculates the new farthest index you can reach *from your current spot*.
* The code then updates `max_index` to be the maximum of either its old value or this new potential reach. This ensures `max_index` always tracks the absolute farthest point you can get to from any position you've visited so far.

***

### **Trace with `nums = [1, 2, 0, 1]`**

Let's trace the values of `i` and `max_index` through the loop:

| Current Position (`i`) | Can I Be Here? (`i > max_index`) | New Reach (`nums[i] + i`) | `max_index` is updated to... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Start** | | | `0` |
| `i = 0` | `0 > 0` is false. OK. | `1 + 0 = 1` | `max(0, 1)` -> `1` |
| `i = 1` | `1 > 1` is false. OK. | `2 + 1 = 3` | `max(1, 3)` -> `3` |
| `i = 2` | `2 > 3` is false. OK. | `0 + 2 = 2` | `max(3, 2)` -> `3` |
| `i = 3` | `3 > 3` is false. OK. | `1 + 3 = 4` | `max(3, 4)` -> `4` |

***

### **6. The Final Result**

```python
        return True
```

The loop finished. We were able to visit every index from 0 to 3 without ever finding our position `i` to be beyond our `max_index`. Since the loop completed successfully, it means the last index was reachable. Therefore, the function returns `True`.
