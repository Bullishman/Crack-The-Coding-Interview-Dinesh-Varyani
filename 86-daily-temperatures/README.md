This code efficiently finds the number of days you have to wait until a warmer temperature. It uses a clever data structure called a **monotonic decreasing stack**.

### The Core Idea

The algorithm iterates through the daily temperatures while maintaining a `stack` of indices. This stack stores the indices of days for which we haven't yet found a future warmer day. The key is that the temperatures corresponding to these indices are kept in **decreasing order** from bottom to top.

When we encounter a new day's temperature that is warmer than the temperature at the top of the stack, we know we've found the answer for that day on the stack. We can then pop it off, calculate the day difference, and repeat until the new temperature is no longer warmer than what's on the stack.

Let's demonstrate this line by line with an example.

**Example:** `temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76]`

### **Initial Setup**

```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```

This defines the main function.

```python
        answer = [0] * len(temperatures)
```

  * **What it does:** An `answer` list is created with the same size as the input and filled with zeros. This `0` will be the final answer for any day that never gets a warmer future day.
  * **For our example:** `answer` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

<!-- end list -->

```python
        stack = []
```

  * **What it does:** An empty list is created to be used as our stack. It will store the **indices** of the days.

-----

### **The Main Loop**

```python
        for i, cur in enumerate(temperatures):
```

  * **What it does:** This loop iterates through the `temperatures` list, giving us both the index `i` and the current temperature `cur` for each day.

#### **The `while` Loop: Finding Warmer Days**

```python
            while stack and cur > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
```

  * **What it does:** This is the core logic. Before adding the current day to our stack, it checks:
    1.  `stack`: Is the stack not empty? (Are there previous days waiting for an answer?)
    2.  `cur > temperatures[stack[-1]]`: Is the current day's temperature `cur` warmer than the temperature of the day at the top of the stack? (`stack[-1]` gets the index at the top).
  * If both are true, we've found a warmer day for the day at the top of the stack.

#### **Processing a Found Answer**

```python
                last = stack.pop()
```

  * **What it does:** We pop the index of the colder day from the stack because we are about to provide its answer.

<!-- end list -->

```python
                answer[last] = i - last
```

  * **What it does:** The waiting period is the difference between the current day's index `i` and the colder day's index `last`. We store this result in our `answer` array at the `last` index.

#### **Adding the Current Day to the Stack**

```python
            stack.append(i)
```

  * **What it does:** After the `while` loop finishes (meaning `cur` is no longer warmer than whatever is left on the stack), we append the index `i` of the **current day**. It will now wait on the stack for its own future warmer day.

-----

### **Final Return**

```python
        return answer
```

  * After the `for` loop has processed all temperatures, the `answer` array is complete and is returned.

### **Live Trace with `temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76]`**

| `i` | `cur` | `stack` (before `while`) | `while` loop action | `stack` (after `append`) | `answer` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | 73 | `[]` | No action (`stack` is empty) | `[0]` | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` |
| **1** | 74 | `[0]` | `74 > 73` is true. Pop 0. `answer[0] = 1-0 = 1`. | `[1]` | `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` |
| **2** | 75 | `[1]` | `75 > 74` is true. Pop 1. `answer[1] = 2-1 = 1`. | `[2]` | `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` |
| **3** | 71 | `[2]` | `71 > 75` is false. No action. | `[2, 3]` | `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` |
| **4** | 69 | `[2, 3]` | `69 > 71` is false. No action. | `[2, 3, 4]` | `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` |
| **5** | 72 | `[2, 3, 4]` | `72 > 69` is true. Pop 4. `answer[4] = 5-4 = 1`. \<br\> `72 > 71` is true. Pop 3. `answer[3] = 5-3 = 2`. \<br\> `72 > 75` is false. | `[2, 5]` | `[1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0]` |
| **6** | 76 | `[2, 5]` | `76 > 72` is true. Pop 5. `answer[5] = 6-5 = 1`. \<br\> `76 > 75` is true. Pop 2. `answer[2] = 6-2 = 4`. | `[6]` | `[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0]` |

The loop finishes. The final `answer` is **`[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0]`**.
