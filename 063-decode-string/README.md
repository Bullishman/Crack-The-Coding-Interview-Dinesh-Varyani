Of course. This code decodes a string that follows a specific encoding rule: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is repeated exactly `k` times. The key to solving this, especially with nested brackets, is to use a **stack**.

The stack helps us "remember" the context (the multiplier and the string we were building) of an outer layer when we dive into an inner, nested layer.

Let's break down the code line by line with a detailed example.

**Example:** `s = "3[a2[c]]"`
**Expected Final Result:** `"accaccacc"`

-----

### **Initial Setup**

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        curr_str = ""
        curr_num = 0
```

  * `stack = []`: An empty list that will be used as a stack. We will push and pop from this list to save and restore our state when we encounter brackets.
  * `curr_str = ""`: This variable holds the string we are actively building at our *current nesting level*.
  * `curr_num = 0`: This variable holds the number/multiplier we are actively building for the *current nesting level*.

-----

### **The Main Loop: Processing the String**

The code iterates through the input string `s` one character at a time.

```python
        for c in s:
```

There are four different cases for what the character `c` can be.

#### **Case 1: The character is a digit**

```python
            if c.isdigit():
                curr_num = curr_num * 10 + int(c)
```

  * **What it does:** If `c` is a digit, we use it to build up the `curr_num`. The `curr_num * 10` logic correctly handles multi-digit numbers (e.g., if we see '1' then '2', `curr_num` first becomes 1, then `1 * 10 + 2 = 12`).

#### **Case 2: The character is an opening bracket `[`**

```python
            elif c == "[":
                stack.append(curr_num)
                stack.append(curr_str)

                curr_num = 0
                curr_str = ""
```

  * **What it does:** An opening bracket means we are starting a new, nested string. We need to save our current progress and start fresh for the inner part.
  * `stack.append(curr_num)`: We push the multiplier we just built onto the stack to save it.
  * `stack.append(curr_str)`: We push the string we've built so far (at this level) onto the stack.
  * `curr_num = 0` and `curr_str = ""`: We reset our "active" variables to start building the new, inner string and its multiplier from scratch.

#### **Case 3: The character is a closing bracket `]`**

```python
            elif c == "]":
                prev_str = stack.pop()
                prev_num = stack.pop()
                curr_str = prev_str + curr_str * prev_num
```

  * **What it does:** A closing bracket means we have finished decoding a nested part. It's time to "resurface" to the previous level.
  * `prev_str = stack.pop()`: We pop from the stack to retrieve the string from the outer layer that we saved earlier.
  * `prev_num = stack.pop()`: We pop again to retrieve the multiplier for that outer layer.
  * `curr_str = prev_str + curr_str * prev_num`: This is the core decoding step.
      * `curr_str * prev_num`: The string we just finished building (`curr_str`) is repeated `prev_num` times.
      * `prev_str + ...`: This result is then prepended with the string from the outer layer (`prev_str`). The combined result becomes our new `curr_str`.

#### **Case 4: The character is a letter**

```python
            else:
                curr_str += c
```

  * **What it does:** If the character is just a normal letter, we append it to the string we are currently building (`curr_str`).

### **Live Trace with `s = "3[a2[c]]"`**

| `c` | `curr_num` | `curr_str` | `stack` | Action |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Start** | 0 | `""` | `[]` | |
| **`3`** | 3 | `""` | `[]` | `c` is a digit. `curr_num = 0 * 10 + 3 = 3`. |
| **`[`** | 0 | `""` | `[3, ""]` | Push `curr_num` (3), push `curr_str` (""). Reset both. |
| **`a`** | 0 | `"a"` | `[3, ""]` | `c` is a letter. Append to `curr_str`. |
| **`2`** | 2 | `"a"` | `[3, ""]` | `c` is a digit. `curr_num = 0 * 10 + 2 = 2`. |
| **`[`** | 0 | `""` | `[3, "", 2, "a"]` | Push `curr_num` (2), push `curr_str` ("a"). Reset both. |
| **`c`** | 0 | `"c"` | `[3, "", 2, "a"]` | `c` is a letter. Append to `curr_str`. |
| **`]`** | 0 | `"acc"` | `[3, ""]` | Pop `prev_str="a"`, pop `prev_num=2`. `curr_str` becomes `"a" + "c" * 2`. |
| **`]`** | 0 | `"accaccacc"` | `[]` | Pop `prev_str=""`, pop `prev_num=3`. `curr_str` becomes `"" + "acc" * 3`. |

The `for` loop has now finished.

-----

### **Final Cleanup and Return**

```python
        while stack:
            curr_str = stack.pop() + curr_str
```

  * **Note:** For a well-formed input string (with matching brackets), the stack should be empty after the first loop finishes, so this loop will not run. It might be included as a safeguard for malformed inputs (e.g., `"a2[b"` without a closing bracket). In our example, `stack` is `[]`, so this loop is skipped.

<!-- end list -->

```python
        return curr_str
```

The function returns the final `curr_str`.

**For our example:** It returns **`"accaccacc"`**.
