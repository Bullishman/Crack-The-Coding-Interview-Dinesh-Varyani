This code implements a **Trie** (pronounced "try"), also known as a **Prefix Tree**. It's a tree-like data structure optimized for storing and retrieving strings. It's the basis for features like auto-complete in search bars. 🌳

The core idea is that each **node** represents a character, and the path from the root to a node represents a prefix.

Let's break down the code using these example operations:

1.  `insert("apple")`
2.  `insert("apply")`
3.  `search("apple")`
4.  `search("app")`
5.  `startsWith("app")`

### The `TrieNode` Class

This class is the basic building block of the trie.

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        # Stores children nodes and whether node is the end of a word
        self.children = {}
        self.isEnd = False
```

  * `self.children`: A **dictionary** where each key is a character (e.g., `'a'`) and the value is another `TrieNode`. This is how we form paths for words.
  * `self.isEnd`: A **boolean** flag that is `True` only if this node represents the end of a complete word. For example, in the word "apple", the node for the final 'e' will have `isEnd = True`.

-----

### The `Trie` Class

This class manages the overall structure and provides the main methods.

```python
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
```

  * `__init__`: When a new `Trie` is created, it initializes a single `root` node. This `root` is empty and serves as the starting point for all words.

-----

### `insert(self, word: str)` Method

This method adds a word to the trie, creating nodes as needed.

```python
    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        cur = self.root
        # Insert character by character into trie
        for c in word:
            # if character path does not exist, create it
            if c not in cur.children:
                cur.children[c] = TrieNode()
            cur = cur.children[c]
        cur.isEnd = True
```

Let's trace `insert("apple")`:

1.  `cur = self.root`: A `cur` pointer starts at the root node.
2.  The `for` loop begins with the first character `c = 'a'`.
3.  `if 'a' not in cur.children:`: The root's `children` dictionary is empty, so this is true.
4.  `cur.children['a'] = TrieNode()`: A new `TrieNode` is created, and the root's `children` map becomes `{'a': <TrieNode>}`.
5.  `cur = cur.children['a']`: The `cur` pointer moves down to the 'a' node.
6.  This process repeats for `'p'`, `'p'`, `'l'`, and `'e'`, creating a chain of nodes.
7.  After the loop finishes, `cur` is at the node for the final `'e'`.
8.  `cur.isEnd = True`: The `isEnd` flag for the 'e' node is set to `True`, marking the end of the word "apple".

After `insert("apple")` and then `insert("apply")`, the trie structure looks like this:

`root` ➡️ `{'a'}` ➡️ `{'p'}` ➡️ `{'p'}` ➡️ `{'l'}` ➡️ `{'e': isEnd=True, 'y': isEnd=True}`

-----

### `search(self, word: str, end=True)` Method

This method checks if a word exists in the trie.

```python
    def search(self, word: str, end=True) -> bool:
        cur = self.root
        # Search character by character in trie
        for c in word:
            # if character path does not exist, return False
            if c not in cur.children:
                return False
            cur = cur.children[c]
        return cur.isEnd if end else True
```

  * **Example 1: `search("apple")`**

    1.  `cur` starts at the root.
    2.  The loop traces the path `a` -\> `p` -\> `p` -\> `l` -\> `e`. The path exists.
    3.  `cur` ends at the `'e'` node.
    4.  `end` is `True` by default, so it returns `cur.isEnd`. The `isEnd` flag for this node is `True`. ✅ **Result: `True`**.

  * **Example 2: `search("app")`**

    1.  `cur` starts at the root.
    2.  The loop traces the path `a` -\> `p` -\> `p`. The path exists.
    3.  `cur` ends at the second `'p'` node.
    4.  It returns `cur.isEnd`. The `isEnd` flag for this node is `False` because "app" was never inserted as a complete word. ❌ **Result: `False`**.

-----

### `startsWith(self, prefix: str)` Method

This method checks if any word starts with the given prefix.

```python
    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        # Same as search, except there is no isEnd condition at final return
        return self.search(prefix, False)
```

  * This method cleverly reuses `search`. It calls `search` with the `prefix` but sets the optional `end` parameter to `False`.

  * **Example: `startsWith("app")`**

    1.  It calls `self.search("app", False)`.
    2.  The search logic traces the path `a` -\> `p` -\> `p`. The path exists.
    3.  `cur` ends at the second `'p'` node.
    4.  The final return line is `return cur.isEnd if end else True`. Since `end` was passed as `False`, this simplifies to `return True`. ✅ **Result: `True`**.
