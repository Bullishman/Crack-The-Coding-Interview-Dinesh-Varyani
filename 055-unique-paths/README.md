Of course. This code calculates the number of unique paths a robot can take on a grid. The robot starts at the top-left corner and can only move **right** or **down**. The goal is to reach the bottom-right corner.

This problem is solved using a classic **Dynamic Programming (DP)** approach. The core idea is that the number of ways to reach any cell `(i, j)` is the sum of the ways to reach the cell above it (`i-1, j`) and the ways to reach the cell to its left (`i, j-1`).

Let's break down the code line by line with an example.

**Example:** `m = 3`, `n = 3` (a 3x3 grid)

-----

### **Initial Setup**

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
```

This defines the function `uniquePaths` which takes the number of rows `m` and columns `n`.

```python
        dp = [[-1] * n for _ in range(m)]
```

  * **What it does:** This line initializes a 2D list (a grid) of size `m x n` which will serve as our DP "table". The `-1` is just a placeholder; its value doesn't matter as it will be overwritten.
  * **Its purpose:** Each cell `dp[i][j]` will store the total number of unique paths from the start `(0, 0)` to the cell `(i, j)`.

**For our 3x3 example, `dp` is initialized as:**

```
[[-1, -1, -1],
 [-1, -1, -1],
 [-1, -1, -1]]
```

-----

### **Filling the DP Table**

```python
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
```

These nested loops iterate through every cell of our `dp` table, starting from `(0, 0)` and filling it out row by row.

#### **The Base Case**

```python
                if i == 0 or j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
```

  * **What it does:** This is the base case for our DP solution. It handles the first row (`i == 0`) and the first column (`j == 0`).
  * **Why:** There is only **one** way to reach any cell in the first row (by moving right continuously from the start) and only **one** way to reach any cell in the first column (by moving down continuously from the start).

**Tracing this on our 3x3 grid:**

  * When `i=0`, the entire first row `dp[0]` is filled with `1`s.
  * When `j=0`, the entire first column `dp` is filled with `1`s.
  * After all the base cases are handled, our `dp` table looks like this:

<!-- end list -->

```
[[1, 1, 1],
 [1, -1, -1],
 [1, -1, -1]]
```

#### **The DP Relation (Recursive Formula)**

```python
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j]
```

  * **What it does:** For any cell that is not in the first row or column, the number of paths to reach it (`dp[i][j]`) is the sum of:
      * `dp[i][j - 1]`: The number of paths to reach the cell to its immediate left.
      * `dp[i - 1][j]`: The number of paths to reach the cell immediately above it.
  * **Why:** Since the robot can only move right or down, to arrive at `(i, j)`, it *must* have come from either `(i, j-1)` (by moving right) or `(i-1, j)` (by moving down). By summing the paths to these two cells, we get all possible unique paths to the current cell.

### **Live Trace for the rest of the 3x3 Grid**

Let's fill in the remaining `-1` cells.

**1. `i = 1`, `j = 1`:**

  * `dp[1][1] = dp[1][0] + dp[0][1]`
  * `dp[1][1] = 1 + 1 = 2`
  * `dp` table:
    ```
    [[1, 1, 1],
     [1, 2, -1],
     [1, -1, -1]]
    ```

**2. `i = 1`, `j = 2`:**

  * `dp[1][2] = dp[1][1] + dp[0][2]`
  * `dp[1][2] = 2 + 1 = 3`
  * `dp` table:
    ```
    [[1, 1, 1],
     [1, 2, 3],
     [1, -1, -1]]
    ```

The first two rows are now complete.

**3. `i = 2`, `j = 1`:**

  * `dp[2][1] = dp[2][0] + dp[1][1]`
  * `dp[2][1] = 1 + 2 = 3`
  * `dp` table:
    ```
    [[1, 1, 1],
     [1, 2, 3],
     [1, 3, -1]]
    ```

**4. `i = 2`, `j = 2`:** (The final cell)

  * `dp[2][2] = dp[2][1] + dp[1][2]`
  * `dp[2][2] = 3 + 3 = 6`
  * `dp` table:
    ```
    [[1, 1, 1],
     [1, 2, 3],
     [1, 3, 6]]
    ```

The loops are now finished.

-----

### **The Final Result**

```python
        return dp[-1][-1]
```

  * The loops have completely filled the `dp` table. The value in the bottom-right corner, `dp[m-1][n-1]`, now holds the total number of unique paths from the start to the finish.
  * `dp[-1][-1]` is a convenient Python syntax to access the last element of the last row.
  * **For our example:** It returns the value at `dp[2][2]`, which is **`6`**.
