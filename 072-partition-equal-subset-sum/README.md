Of course. This code solves the "Partition Equal Subset Sum" problem using a highly efficient and clever **bit manipulation (bitmasking)** approach to dynamic programming.

### The Core Idea

The problem asks if we can partition the numbers into two subsets with an equal sum. This is only possible if the `total` sum of all numbers is even. If it is, the problem then becomes: "Can we find a subset of numbers that sums up to exactly `total / 2`?" If we can, the remaining numbers will also sum to that same value, and we have our answer.

Instead of using a traditional DP array or set to keep track of the sums we can make, this solution uses a single integer as a **bitmask**. You can think of this integer as a big boolean array, where if the `k`-th bit is `1`, it means a sum of `k` is achievable.

Let's break down the code line by line with an example.

**Example:** `nums = [1, 5, 11, 5]`
**Expected Result:** `True` (One partition is `[11]`, the other is `[1, 5, 5]`. Both sum to 11).

### **Initial Setup and Pre-checks**

```python
class Solution:
    def canPartition(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
```

This defines the main function `canPartition`.

```python
        total = sum(nums)
```

First, calculate the total sum of all numbers in the list.

  * **For our example:** `total = 1 + 5 + 11 + 5 = 22`.

<!-- end list -->

```python
        if total % 2 != 0:
            return False
```

This is a quick check for an impossible case. If the total sum is odd, it's impossible to divide it into two equal integer halves.

  * **For our example:** `22 % 2 == 0`, so this check passes.

<!-- end list -->

```python
        target = total // 2
```

This calculates the target sum we need to achieve for one of the subsets.

  * **For our example:** `target = 22 // 2 = 11`.

### **The Bitmask DP**

This is where the clever part begins.

```python
        dp = 1 << 0
```

  * **What it does:** This initializes our dynamic programming "state", which is stored in the integer variable `dp`.
      * `1 << 0`: This is a left bit shift. It takes the number 1 (binary `...001`) and shifts it left by 0 places. The result is just `1`.
  * **What it represents:** We will use the bits of the `dp` integer to represent achievable sums. If the `k`-th bit is `1`, it means we can form a sum of `k`.
      * By setting `dp = 1`, we are setting the 0th bit to `1`. This represents our base case: **a sum of 0 is always achievable** (by picking the empty subset).
  * **Initial State:** `dp = 1` (Binary: `...00000001`)

### **The Main Loop and DP Transition**

```python
        for num in nums:
            dp |= dp << num
```

This loop iterates through each `num` in our input list and updates the `dp` bitmask to include the new sums that are now possible by using `num`. Let's break down the core line `dp |= dp << num`:

1.  **`dp << num` (Left Bit Shift):** This operation takes all the "on" bits in `dp` (representing current achievable sums) and shifts them to the left by `num` positions.

      * **What this means:** If we could previously make a sum `s` (so the `s`-th bit was 1), adding our current `num` to it gives a new sum of `s + num`. Shifting the bit from position `s` to `s + num` represents exactly this. This single operation calculates all new possible sums.

2.  **`dp |= ...` (Bitwise OR Assignment):** This merges the newly calculated sums with our existing sums. The `dp` bitmask will now have a `1` at every position that was achievable *before* considering `num`, AND at every new position that is achievable *by using* `num`.

#### **Live Trace with `nums = [1, 5, 11, 5]`**

  * **Initial State:** `dp = 1`. (Binary: `...0001`). Achievable sums: `{0}`.

  * **Process `num = 1`:**

      * `dp << 1`: `1 << 1` gives `2`. (Binary: `...0010`).
      * `dp |= 2`: `1 | 2` gives `3`.
      * **`dp` is now `3`**. (Binary: `...0011`). Achievable sums: `{0, 1}`.

  * **Process `num = 5`:**

      * `dp << 5`: `3 << 5` shifts `...0011` left by 5, giving `...01100000` (which is 96).
      * `dp |= 96`: `3 | 96` gives `99`.
      * **`dp` is now `99`**. (Binary: `...01100011`). Achievable sums: `{0, 1, 5, 6}`.

  * **Process `num = 11`:**

      * `dp << 11`: `99 << 11`. This will turn on bits for `0+11`, `1+11`, `5+11`, `6+11`.
      * `dp |= (dp << 11)`. The new `dp` now also represents sums of {11, 12, 16, 17}, in addition to the old ones.
      * **`dp` is updated**. Achievable sums now include: `{0, 1, 5, 6, 11, 12, 16, 17}`.

  * **Process `num = 5` (the second 5):**

      * `dp << 5`: This will create new achievable sums by adding 5 to all existing sums. For example, since `{1, 6, 11}` were achievable, adding 5 gives `{6, 11, 16}`, which are now also marked as achievable.
      * **`dp` is updated again**.

-----

### **The Final Check**

After the loop, the `dp` bitmask contains a complete record of every possible subset sum.

```python
        return (dp & (1 << target)) != 0
```

  * **What it does:** This line checks if the bit corresponding to our `target` sum is "on" in our final `dp` bitmask.
  * **`(1 << target)`**: This creates a "tester" mask. It's an integer that is all zeros, except for a single `1` at the `target` position.
      * **For our example:** `target` is 11. `1 << 11` creates a number where only the 11th bit is 1.
  * **`dp & ...` (Bitwise AND):** This operation compares our final `dp` state with the tester mask. The result will be non-zero *if and only if* the target bit was `1` in both numbers.
  * **`!= 0`**: If the result of the AND operation is not zero, it means the `target` bit was indeed set in `dp`, so a subset with that sum is possible. The function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

**For our example:** After the loop, the 11th bit of `dp` *will* be set (from the `11` itself, and from `1+5+5`). Therefore, the AND operation will be non-zero, and the function correctly returns **`True`**.
