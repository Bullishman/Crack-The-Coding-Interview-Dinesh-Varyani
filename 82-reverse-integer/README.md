This function reverses the digits of a 32-bit signed integer, handling the sign and checking for potential overflow.

Let's demonstrate it with the example `x = -123`.

-----

### Function Definition

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
```

This defines the function `reverse` which takes an integer `x` as input.

-----

### Determining the Sign

```python
        sign = [1, -1][x < 0]
```

This line cleverly determines the sign of the input number.

  - The expression `x < 0` evaluates to a boolean, `True` or `False`.
  - In Python, `False` can be used as index `0`, and `True` can be used as index `1`.
  - If `x` is positive or zero, `x < 0` is `False`, so `sign` becomes `[1, -1][0]`, which is `1`.
  - If `x` is negative, `x < 0` is `True`, so `sign` becomes `[1, -1][1]`, which is `-1`.

**For our example `x = -123`:**

  - `-123 < 0` is `True`.
  - `sign` is set to `-1`.

### Reversing the Digits

```python
        rst = sign * int(str(abs(x))[::-1])
```

This is the core line where the reversal happens. It's best understood from the inside out:

1.  `abs(x)`: Takes the absolute value of `x` to ignore the sign during reversal.
      - **Example:** `abs(-123)` becomes `123`.
2.  `str(...)`: Converts the number to a string.
      - **Example:** `123` becomes `"123"`.
3.  `[::-1]`: This is Python's slice notation to reverse a sequence.
      - **Example:** `"123"` becomes `"321"`.
4.  `int(...)`: Converts the reversed string back to an integer.
      - **Example:** `"321"` becomes `321`.
5.  `sign * ...`: Multiplies the reversed number by the sign we stored earlier.
      - **Example:** `-1 * 321` becomes `-321`.

**For our example, `rst` is now `-321`**.

### Checking for Overflow

```python
        return rst if -(2**31) <= rst <= (2**31) - 1 else 0
```

This line ensures the reversed integer fits within the standard 32-bit signed integer range, which is from `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647`.

  - It checks if `rst` is within these bounds.
  - If it is, the function returns the reversed number `rst`.
  - If `rst` is outside this range (an overflow), the function returns `0` as required by the problem's constraints.

**For our example:**

  - `rst` is `-321`.
  - The condition `-2147483648 <= -321 <= 2147483647` is **true**.
  - The function returns **-321**.
