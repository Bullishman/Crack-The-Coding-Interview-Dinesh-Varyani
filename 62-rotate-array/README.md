Of course. This code rotates an array to the right by `k` steps. It's a very clear and direct approach that uses an auxiliary copy of the array to place each element in its new, correct position.

The core idea is to calculate the destination index for each element using modular arithmetic, which elegantly handles the "wrap-around" effect of rotation.

Let's break down the code line by line with an example.

**Example:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, `k = 3`

**Expected Final Result:** `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

### **Initial Setup**

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
```

  * This defines the function `rotate`. The type hint `-> None` and the docstring indicate that the function will modify the input list `nums` directly and will not return a new list.

### **Step 1: Create a Copy**

```python
        copied_nums = nums[:]
```

  * **What it does:** This line creates a shallow copy of the original `nums` list.
  * **Why it's necessary:** If we tried to move elements around within the single original list, we would overwrite values before we had a chance to move them. For example, if we move the `1` from index 0 to its new position, we would overwrite the number that was originally there. By creating a copy, we have a clean, untouched version of the array to read from (`copied_nums`) while we modify the original `nums` array.

**For our example:**

  * `nums` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  * `copied_nums` is also `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`

-----

### **Step 2: The Main Loop and Placement**

```python
        for i, num in enumerate(copied_nums):
```

  * This loop iterates through our **copy** of the array.
  * `enumerate` is a convenient Python function that gives us both the index (`i`) and the value (`num`) for each element in the list.

<!-- end list -->

```python
            nums[(i + k) % len(nums)] = copied_nums[i]
```

This is the core logic where the actual rotation happens. Let's break down the calculation for the destination index:

1.  **`i + k`**: This calculates the new position if the array were infinitely long. An element at index `i` should move `k` steps to the right.
2.  **`% len(nums)`**: This is the modulo operator. It's the key to handling the "wrap-around". When a number is moved past the end of the array, the modulo operator calculates its correct new position at the beginning of the array. The result of `X % Y` is the remainder when `X` is divided by `Y`.

This line takes the element at index `i` from our clean copy (`copied_nums[i]`) and places it into the original `nums` array at its new, correctly calculated position.

### **Live Trace with `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `k = 3`**

`copied_nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, `len(nums) = 7`
The original `nums` will be modified in each step.

| `i` | `copied_nums[i]` | New Index `(i + 3) % 7` | Action | `nums` after this step |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | 1 | `(0 + 3) % 7 = 3` | `nums[3] = 1` | `[1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7]` |
| **1** | 2 | `(1 + 3) % 7 = 4` | `nums[4] = 2` | `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 7]` |
| **2** | 3 | `(2 + 3) % 7 = 5` | `nums[5] = 3` | `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 7]` |
| **3** | 4 | `(3 + 3) % 7 = 6` | `nums[6] = 4` | `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]` |
| **4** | 5 | `(4 + 3) % 7 = 0` | `nums[0] = 5` | `[5, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]` |
| **5** | 6 | `(5 + 3) % 7 = 1` | `nums[1] = 6` | `[5, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]` |
| **6** | 7 | `(6 + 3) % 7 = 2` | `nums[2] = 7` | `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]` |

The loop is now finished.

**Final Result:** The original `nums` list has been modified in-place to `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is the correct rotation.

This method also works correctly if `k` is larger than the length of the array. For example, if `k = 10` for our array of length 7, `10 % 7 = 3`, so rotating by 10 is the same as rotating by 3, and the modulo math handles this automatically.
