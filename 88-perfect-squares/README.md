Of course. This code solves the "Perfect Squares" problem, which asks for the *least* number of perfect square numbers (like 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) that sum up to a given integer `n`.

The solution uses a bottom-up **Dynamic Programming (DP)** approach.

### The Core Idea

The fundamental principle is that the solution for a number `n`, let's call it `dp[n]`, can be found by using the solutions for numbers smaller than `n`.

To find the minimum squares for `n`, we can think of it like this:
`n = (some perfect square) + (a remainder)`
`dp[n] = 1 + dp[remainder]`

Since we want the *minimum*, we try this for all possible perfect squares that are less than or equal to `n`.
For example, for `n=12`:

  * `dp[12]` could be `1 + dp[12 - 1*1] = 1 + dp[11]`
  * `dp[12]` could be `1 + dp[12 - 2*2] = 1 + dp[8]`
  * `dp[12]` could be `1 + dp[12 - 3*3] = 1 + dp[3]`

We take the minimum value among all these possibilities.

Let's break down the code line by line with an example.

**Example:** `n = 12`
**Expected Result:** `3` (because `12 = 4 + 4 + 4`)

-----

### **Initial Setup**

```python
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
```

This defines the function `numSquares` which takes the integer `n`.

```python
        dp = [0] + [float('inf')] * n
```

  * **What it does:** This creates our DP table, which is a list named `dp` of size `n+1`.
  * **Its purpose:** Each cell `dp[i]` will store the final calculated answer for the number `i`.
  * `[0]`: We set `dp[0]` to `0`. This is our crucial **base case**. It takes `0` squares to make a sum of 0.
  * `[float('inf')] * n`: The rest of the list is initialized to infinity. This is a standard DP practice. It acts as a placeholder value that is guaranteed to be larger than any real answer, so our first calculated result for any `dp[i]` will always be smaller.

**For our `n=12` example, `dp` starts as:** `[0, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf]`

-----

### **The DP Calculation Loops**

```python
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
```

This is the outer loop. It iterates through each number `i` from `1` up to our target `n`. The goal of each iteration is to calculate the final answer for `dp[i]`.

```python
            for j in range(1, int(i ** 0.5) + 1):
```

  * This is the inner loop. For each number `i`, it efficiently iterates through all possible perfect squares we could subtract.
  * `int(i ** 0.5) + 1`: This calculates all integer square roots `j` such that `j*j <= i`.
  * In each iteration, `j*j` is the perfect square we are considering.

#### **The DP Recurrence Relation**

```python
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j * j] + 1)
```

  * **This is the core DP formula.** It updates the answer for `dp[i]`.
  * It calculates a potential new answer: `dp[i - j*j] + 1`. This means, "the minimum squares needed for the remainder (`i - j*j`), plus one more for the square `j*j` we just used."
  * `min(dp[i], ...)`: It compares this new potential answer with the current value of `dp[i]` (which might be `inf` or a value from a previous inner loop iteration) and keeps whichever is smaller.

### **Live Trace with `n = 12`**

Let's trace the calculation for a few key values of `i`.

  * **Initial State:** `dp = [0, inf, inf, ...]`

  * **`i = 1`**:

      * Inner loop `j=1` (`j*j=1`): `dp[1] = min(inf, dp[1-1] + 1) = min(inf, dp[0]+1) = 1`.
      * `dp[1]` is `1`.

  * **`i = 2`**:

      * Inner loop `j=1` (`j*j=1`): `dp[2] = min(inf, dp[2-1] + 1) = min(inf, dp[1]+1) = 2`.
      * `dp[2]` is `2`.

  * **`i = 3`**:

      * Inner loop `j=1` (`j*j=1`): `dp[3] = min(inf, dp[3-1] + 1) = min(inf, dp[2]+1) = 3`.
      * `dp[3]` is `3`.

  * **`i = 4`**:

      * `j=1` (`j*j=1`): `dp[4]` becomes `min(inf, dp[3]+1) = 4`.
      * `j=2` (`j*j=4`): `dp[4]` becomes `min(4, dp[4-4]+1) = min(4, dp[0]+1) = 1`.
      * `dp[4]` is `1`.

... The process continues, filling the `dp` table ...

  * **`i = 12`**:
      * `j=1` (`j*j=1`): `dp[12]` becomes `min(inf, dp[11]+1)`. Let's assume we already found `dp[11]=3` (from `9+1+1`). So, `dp[12]` becomes `4`.
      * `j=2` (`j*j=4`): `dp[12]` becomes `min(4, dp[8]+1)`. We would have already found `dp[8]=2` (from `4+4`). So, `dp[12]` becomes `min(4, 2+1) = 3`.
      * `j=3` (`j*j=9`): `dp[12]` becomes `min(3, dp[3]+1)`. We know `dp[3]=3`. So, `dp[12]` becomes `min(3, 3+1) = 3`.

**Final State of `dp` table for `n=12`:** `[0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3]`

Of course. A table is an excellent way to visualize the "bottom-up" nature of this dynamic programming solution.

### How to Read the Table

* **`i` (Target Sum):** The number we are currently trying to find the minimum number of squares for. The goal of all the calculations in a given `i` section is to find the final value for `dp[i]`.
* **`j` (Test Root):** The square root we are testing.
* **`j*j` (Square):** The perfect square we are subtracting (`j` squared).
* **Calculation:** The formula `dp[i - j*j] + 1`. This calculates a *potential* new minimum value for `dp[i]`. It means "the answer for the remainder, plus 1 (for the square we just used)".
* **`dp[i]` Update:** Shows how `dp[i]` is updated by taking the minimum of its current value and the new value from the calculation.

**Final `dp` Array State:** `[0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3]`

The final answer is the value at `dp[12]`, which is **3**.

```

After the loops complete, `dp[n]` holds the minimum number of perfect squares required to sum to `n`.

  * **For our example:** The function returns `dp[12]`, which is **`3`**.
