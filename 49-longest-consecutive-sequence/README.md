Of course. This code provides an efficient solution to find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence in an unsorted list of integers.

The core idea is to use a `set` for very fast lookups (O(1) on average) and to only start counting a sequence when we find its true starting number. This avoids redundant work and achieves an overall time complexity of O(n).

Let's break down the code line by line with an example.

**Example:** `nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`

The goal is to find the length of the longest sequence, which is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, so the answer should be 4.

-----

### **Initial Setup**

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
```

This defines the function `longestConsecutive` that takes a list of integers `nums`.

```python
        nums_set = set(nums)
```

  * **What it does:** This line converts the input list `nums` into a Python `set`.
  * **Why:** Checking if an element exists in a `set` (e.g., `if x in my_set:`) is extremely fast. This is the key to the algorithm's performance.
  * **For our example:** `nums_set` becomes `{1, 2, 3, 4, 100, 200}`. The order doesn't matter in a set.

<!-- end list -->

```python
        longest_seq = 0
```

A variable `longest_seq` is initialized to `0`. This will be used to keep track of the maximum length we have found so far.

-----

### **The Main Loop**

```python
        for num in nums:
```

This loop iterates through each number in the **original** `nums` list. The order of iteration does not matter.

-----

### **The Key Optimization: Finding the Start of a Sequence**

```python
            if num - 1 not in nums_set:
```

  * **What it does:** This is the most important line in the algorithm. For each number `num`, it checks if the number immediately preceding it (`num - 1`) is present in our set.
  * **Why:** If `num - 1` **is** in the set, it means that `num` is part of a sequence that started earlier. For example, if our current `num` is `4`, we check for `3`. Since `3` is in the set, we know `4` is not the beginning of a sequence, so we can ignore it and wait until we get to the actual starting number (`1` in this case).
  * **The Benefit:** This check ensures that we only start counting a sequence from its absolute beginning. This prevents us from recounting the same sequence multiple times (e.g., counting `[2, 3, 4]`, then `[3, 4]`, then `[4]`). Because of this, the inner `while` loop will only execute for numbers that are the start of a sequence.

-----

### **Counting the Sequence Length**

This inner block is only executed if the `if` condition above is true (i.e., we have found the starting number of a sequence).

```python
                length = 0
```

A temporary variable `length` is initialized to `0` to count the length of the current consecutive sequence.

```python
                while num + length in nums_set:
                    length += 1
```

  * This `while` loop checks if the next number in the potential sequence (`num + length`) exists in our `nums_set`.
  * For the first iteration, `length` is `0`, so it checks if `num + 0` (the number itself) is in the set.
  * If it is, `length` is incremented to `1`. The loop then checks for `num + 1`, and so on.
  * The loop continues until it finds a "gap" in the sequence.

<!-- end list -->

```python
                longest_seq = max(longest_seq, length)
```

Once the `while` loop finishes, `length` holds the total length of the sequence we just counted. This line updates our `longest_seq` variable to be the maximum of its old value and the new `length` we just found.

-----

### **The Final Return**

```python
        return longest_seq
```

After the main `for` loop has checked every number in the input list, `longest_seq` will hold the length of the longest sequence found, and it is returned.

### **Live Trace with `nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`**
