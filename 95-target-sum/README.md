Absolutely. Here is a detailed demonstration of the code using a "Live Trace Table Map" format to show how the `dp` array evolves.

### The Algorithm's Core Idea

First, a quick reminder of the strategy. The code transforms the "Target Sum" problem into a **"Subset Sum" problem**.

1.  **The Goal:** Find the number of subsets `P` whose elements get a `+` sign, such that `sum(P) = (total_sum + target) / 2`.
2.  **The DP State:** The list `dp` is our dynamic programming table, where `dp[j]` stores the **number of ways** to form a subset that sums up to exactly `j`.

Let's trace the code with a new example to see how it works.

**Example:** `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, `target = 0`

### **Line-by-Line Demonstration**

**1. Initial Calculations**

```python
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        # total_sum = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
```

The total sum of the numbers is calculated.

```python
        if (total_sum + target) % 2 != 0 or total_sum < abs(target):
            return 0
        # (6 + 0) % 2 = 0. This is fine.
        # 6 < abs(0) is False. This is fine.
        # The checks pass.
```

The code ensures a solution is arithmetically possible.

```python
        subset_sum_target = (total_sum + target) // 2
        # subset_sum_target = (6 + 0) // 2 = 3
```

Our new goal is to find the number of subsets in `[1, 2, 3]` that sum to **3**.

**2. DP Array Setup**

```python
        dp = [0] * (subset_sum_target + 1)
        # dp = [0] * (3 + 1) -> dp is initialized as [0, 0, 0, 0]
        
        dp[0] = 1
        # dp becomes [1, 0, 0, 0]
```

We set up the `dp` array. `dp[0]` is `1` because there is always one way to make a sum of 0 (by choosing the empty subset `{}`).

### **Live Trace Table Map**

This trace shows the state of the `dp` array after each number from the `nums` list is fully processed. The key is to remember that the inner `j` loop runs **backwards**.

**Initial State:**
The `dp` array represents the number of ways to make sums from 0 to 3.
`dp = [1, 0, 0, 0]`

-----

**Pass 1: Processing `num = 1`**

  * **`dp` at Start:** `[1, 0, 0, 0]`
  * **Inner Loop Calculations (`j` from 3 down to 1):**
      * `j=3`: `dp[3]` += `dp[3-1]` =\> `dp[3]` += `dp[2]` =\> `0 + 0 = 0`
      * `j=2`: `dp[2]` += `dp[2-1]` =\> `dp[2]` += `dp[1]` =\> `0 + 0 = 0`
      * `j=1`: `dp[1]` += `dp[1-1]` =\> `dp[1]` += `dp[0]` =\> `0 + 1 = 1`
  * **`dp` at End of Pass:** `[1, 1, 0, 0]`
      * *Meaning: With the number `1`, we can make a sum of `0` (1 way: {}) and a sum of `1` (1 way: `{1}`).*

-----

**Pass 2: Processing `num = 2`**

  * **`dp` at Start:** `[1, 1, 0, 0]`
  * **Inner Loop Calculations (`j` from 3 down to 2):**
      * `j=3`: `dp[3]` += `dp[3-2]` =\> `dp[3]` += `dp[1]` =\> `0 + 1 = 1`
      * `j=2`: `dp[2]` += `dp[2-2]` =\> `dp[2]` += `dp[0]` =\> `0 + 1 = 1`
  * **`dp` at End of Pass:** `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
      * *Meaning: With numbers `{1, 2}`, we can make sum `1` ({1}), sum `2` ({2}), and sum `3` ({1, 2}).*

-----

**Pass 3: Processing `num = 3`**

  * **`dp` at Start:** `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
  * **Inner Loop Calculations (`j` from 3 down to 3):**
      * `j=3`: `dp[3]` += `dp[3-3]` =\> `dp[3]` += `dp[0]` =\> `1 + 1 = 2`
  * **`dp` at End of Pass:** `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
      * *Meaning: With `{1, 2, 3}`, we can now make sum `3` in two ways: `{1, 2}` and `{3}`.*

-----

### **Final Result**

The `for num in nums:` loop is complete. The function executes its final line:

```python
        return dp[subset_sum_target]
```

  * This returns `dp[3]`.
  * Looking at our final `dp` array state `[1, 1, 1, 2]`, the value at index 3 is **2**.

The function correctly returns `2`. This corresponds to the two original ways to get a target of 0: `(+1 -2 +3)` and `(-1 +2 -3)` are not the ways. Let's recheck.

  * `sum(P)=3`. Subsets summing to 3 are `{1,2}` and `{3}`.
      * If `P={1,2}`, then `N={3}`. Sum = `(1+2) - 3 = 0`. This is one way.
      * If `P={3}`, then `N={1,2}`. Sum = `3 - (1+2) = 0`. This is the second way.

The trace is accurate.
